## 6th Annual SHSNY Day of Reason Brunch

Sunday, May 4th, 12 Noon, at historic Pete's Tavern
[129 East 18 Street](http://g.co/maps/h5qtb) (at Irving Place) <br/>
Brunch, Presentation & Discussion <br/>
with guest speaker Liz Heywood <br/>
Religious Overdose: My Survival of Childhood Medical Neglect

Liz Heywood grew up in Christian Science and at age 13 was prayed over
rather than medically treated for a bone disease. As an adult she
ended years of pain by having a leg amputated, and has since become a
leading advocate for child victims of religious abuse.

Don't miss her gripping story, and join 40 or more of your fellow
freethinkers for one of SHSNY's best annual get-togethers.

Brunch is $25, all in. Save 20% ($5) by reserving now.
