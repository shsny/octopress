The Secular Humanist Society of New York was founded on February 10,
1988, when fourteen persons, solicited from the _Free Inquiry_
magazine mailing list, met at Variety Recording Studios on 42nd Street
in Manhattan.  While SHSNY's steadily growing membership is of course
concentrated in the greater New York metropolitan area, we are pleased
to have members (and subscribers to our newsletter, PIQUE) from as far
away as Florida and California, Liechtenstein and Australia.

SHSNY is a non-profit organization (your dues are tax-deductible).  We
are an Affiliated Local Group of the Council for Secular Humanism and
the Atheist Alliance International, and are a Charter Chapter of the
American Humanist Association.
